                    <h5>Bandung, Januari 2020</h5>
                    <p>ITBMUN 2020 which was held in Bandung was the first MUN that I participated in, at that time I joined UNESCO which discussed "how the world preserves both tangible and intangible heritage" in that forum I represented Singapore to represent
                        Singapore in the UN general session on this issue. , Just like in general ITBMUN starts with a general speech with a time of 1.5 minutes. At the General Mun time, as the Singapore delegation, I presented Singapore's success in
                        preserving its ancestral heritage where Singapore's tangible culture had a pretty good policy and was able to protect its heritages maximally even so on intangible culture in Singapore, where in our country we already have a pretty
                        good protection with cultural programs that are displayed like an opera house. at the open debate session, as a Singapore delegation and to promote Singapore's success in preserving its cultural heritage we offered solutions to
                        be used in the global arena so we decided to cooperate in the Asian block which at that time against western countries where they oppose the preservation of our cultural traditions which is considered too conservative. The debate
                        that took place was quite heated and continued until the voting session was held. At that time the Singapore delegation chose to present and vote, which means we chose to exercise our rights in voting and support the resolution
                        proposed by our block, namely "offering solutions to the world in preserving culture with an Asian approach", and the voting was successful we won with a ratio of 25:13 where there were two countries that abstained, namely Indonesia
                        and Greece. I'm glad that my team can win this general assembly</p>
